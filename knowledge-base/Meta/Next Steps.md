## Open Questions to Resolve

See: [[Open Questions]] and [[Architecture Decisions]]

**Already decided:**
1. ✅ WYSIWYG vs Source: Toggle (hybrid approach)
2. ✅ Progressive Disclosure: Not implementing automatic detection
3. ✅ Open Source: EPL 2.0, fully open source
4. ✅ Business Model: Free core, sell custom AI agents
5. ✅ File Organization: Flat namespace view

**Still to decide:**
1. ⏳ Obsidian Compatibility: Full or inspired-by?
2. ⏳ Graph view click behavior
3. ⏳ AI provider choice

## Resources Needed

### Development

- [ ] Theia expertise
- [ ] React/Monaco experience

### Design

- [ ] UI/UX designer
- [ ] Obsidian-like design system
- [ ] Icons and assets

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Build server
- [ ] Website hosting
- [ ] Documentation site

## Success Metrics

### Technical

- [ ] Wiki links: <50ms autocomplete
- [ ] Graph: Handles 1000+ notes
- [ ] Startup: <5 seconds
- [ ] Indexing: <1 second for 100 notes

### User Experience

- [ ] Onboarding: <5 min to first note
- [ ] Migration: Import Obsidian vault
- [ ] Learning curve: Intuitive for beginners

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Theia updates break our fork
**Mitigation:** Stay close to Theia releases, contribute upstream

**Risk:** WYSIWYG performance issues
**Mitigation:** Start with Monaco, add WYSIWYG gradually

**Risk:** Graph view doesn't scale
**Mitigation:** Implement virtual rendering, WebGL fallback

### Product Risks

**Risk:** Too similar to Obsidian
**Mitigation:** Focus on differentiators (progressive disclosure, code execution)

**Risk:** Too complex for target users
**Mitigation:** User testing early and often
