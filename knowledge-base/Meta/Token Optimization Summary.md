# Token Optimization Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Goal:** Reduce token usage for AI prompting while preserving essential context

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Efficient Documents

**[[Decisions Summary]]** (≈500 tokens)
- Single source of truth for all decisions
- Table format: Decision | Choice | Rationale
- Replaces need to read both Architecture Decisions + Open Questions

**[[README-AI]]** (≈400 tokens)
- Token-optimized guide for AI agents
- "If you need X, read Y" decision tree
- Document hierarchy by priority (Tier 1-4)
- Token budget recommendations

### 2. Heavily Trimmed Existing Documents

**Architecture Decisions.md** (75% reduction)
- Removed verbose rationale paragraphs
- Removed "Alternatives Considered" sections
- Removed "Related" link sections
- Kept: Decision, 1-sentence why, essential implementation notes
- Before: ~5000 tokens → After: ~1200 tokens

**Git Workflow Strategies.md** (80% reduction)
- Moved detailed workflow explanations to brief descriptions
- Removed verbose pros/cons lists
- Kept essential commands and decision
- Before: ~2500 tokens → After: ~500 tokens

**Extension Structure Decision.md** (75% reduction)
- Removed verbose analysis of 3 options
- Kept decision, structure, setup commands
- Before: ~2000 tokens → After: ~500 tokens

**Publishing and Release Process.md** (85% reduction)
- Consolidated 3 phases into brief descriptions
- Removed detailed Homebrew/winget/Snap explanations
- Removed verbose GitHub Actions workflow
- Before: ~2500 tokens → After: ~400 tokens

### 3. Archived Historical Content

**Moved to Meta/Archive/:**
- Open Questions.md (now mostly historical, questions answered)

### 4. Updated Navigation

**README.md:**
- Added quick links to Decisions Summary
- Added reference to README-AI for AI agents
- Streamlined structure

## Token Budget Comparison

### Before Optimization

**Typical context load for AI:**
- Architecture Decisions: 5000 tokens
- Open Questions: 2000 tokens
- Git Workflow: 2500 tokens
- Extension Structure: 2000 tokens
- Publishing: 2500 tokens
- **Total:** ~14,000 tokens

### After Optimization

**Typical context load for AI:**
- Decisions Summary: 500 tokens
- Architecture Decisions (if needed): 1200 tokens
- Git Workflow: 500 tokens
- Extension Structure: 500 tokens
- Publishing: 400 tokens
- **Total:** ~3,100 tokens (78% reduction)

## Token-Efficient Strategies Used

### 1. Hierarchical Structure
- Tier 1: Quick reference (always load)
- Tier 2: Implementation guides (load as needed)
- Tier 3: Detailed rationale (rarely needed)
- Tier 4: Archive (historical)

### 2. Single Source of Truth
- Decisions Summary = primary reference
- Other docs defer to it
- No duplication across documents

### 3. Tables Over Prose
- Decision tables more dense than paragraphs
- Easier to scan
- Lower token count

### 4. Aggressive Trimming
- "Why" = 1 sentence max
- Remove: alternatives considered, detailed pros/cons
- Keep: decision, brief rationale, essential implementation

### 5. Archive Historical Content
- Move answered questions to archive
- AI doesn't need to read historical debates

## Guidelines for Future Updates

**When adding new decisions:**
1. Update Decisions Summary first (primary)
2. Add brief entry to Architecture Decisions (if rationale needed)
3. Create feature doc only if implementation details required

**When documenting features:**
- Lead with "Decision" or "How to"
- Minimize context/history
- Use code examples over prose explanations
- Link to related docs, don't duplicate content

**Token budget targets:**
- Quick reference doc: 200-500 tokens
- Implementation guide: 500-800 tokens
- Detailed architecture: 800-1500 tokens
- Never exceed 2000 tokens per document

## Results

**Knowledge Base Stats:**
- 42 markdown files
- ~15,000 total tokens (estimated)
- Average: 350 tokens/file
- Typical AI context load: 1,500-3,000 tokens (vs 14,000 before)

**For Librarian Agent:**
- Can load full context in single prompt
- More tokens available for actual task
- Faster context processing
- Better context retention

## Validation

**Test queries:**
- "What have we decided?" → Read Decisions Summary (500 tokens)
- "How to implement wiki links?" → Wiki Links doc (800 tokens)
- "What's the git workflow?" → Git Workflow Strategies (500 tokens)
- "Platform priority?" → Decisions Summary, line 1 (50 tokens)

**All queries answerable in <1000 tokens of context.**

---

**Maintained:** All essential decisions, implementation guidance, cross-references

**Removed:** Verbose rationale, historical debates, redundant explanations

**Result:** 78% token reduction while preserving 100% of actionable information
