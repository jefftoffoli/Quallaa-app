## Open Questions to Resolve

See: [[Open Questions]]

Before implementing, answer:

1. **WYSIWYG vs Source:** Toggle or WYSIWYG-only?
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Ask upfront or auto-detect?
3. **Open Source:** License choice?
4. **Business Model:** Free or paid features?
5. **Obsidian Compatibility:** Full or inspired-by?

## Resources Needed

### Development

- [ ] 3-4 months full-time development
- [ ] Theia expertise
- [ ] React/Monaco experience
- [ ] D3.js for graphs

### Design

- [ ] UI/UX designer
- [ ] Obsidian-like design system
- [ ] Icons and assets

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Build server
- [ ] Website hosting
- [ ] Documentation site

## Success Metrics

### Technical

- [ ] Wiki links: <50ms autocomplete
- [ ] Graph: Handles 1000+ notes
- [ ] Startup: <5 seconds
- [ ] Indexing: <1 second for 100 notes

### User Experience

- [ ] Onboarding: <5 min to first note
- [ ] Migration: Import Obsidian vault
- [ ] Learning curve: Intuitive for beginners

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Theia updates break our fork
**Mitigation:** Stay close to Theia releases, contribute upstream

**Risk:** WYSIWYG performance issues
**Mitigation:** Start with Monaco, add WYSIWYG gradually

**Risk:** Graph view doesn't scale
**Mitigation:** Implement virtual rendering, WebGL fallback

### Product Risks

**Risk:** Too similar to Obsidian
**Mitigation:** Focus on differentiators (progressive disclosure, code execution)

**Risk:** Too complex for target users
**Mitigation:** User testing early and often
