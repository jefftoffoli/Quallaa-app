# Natural Language Developers

## Who They Are

**Natural Language Developers** = People who think and work primarily in natural language (English/etc.) but occasionally need to write or execute code.

## Characteristics

### Primary Tools
- 📝 Markdown documents
- 🤖 AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- 📚 Knowledge bases (Obsidian, Notion)
- 📊 Diagrams and documentation

### Secondary Tools
- 💻 Code editors (when needed)
- 🔧 Terminal (occasionally)
- 📦 Git (basic usage)

## Workflow

```
1. Think and design in markdown
   ↓
2. Describe what they want in natural language
   ↓
3. Use AI to generate code
   ↓
4. Test and iterate
   ↓
5. Document learnings back in markdown
```

## Not "Non-Technical"

These people ARE technical, but:
- ❌ Don't want to memorize syntax
- ❌ Don't enjoy low-level implementation
- ✅ Understand concepts and logic
- ✅ Can read and understand code
- ✅ Know what they want to build

## Examples

### Product Manager who Codes
```
"I know what the feature should do.
I can write the spec in markdown.
AI helps me implement it.
I can verify it works."
```

### Technical Writer
```
"I document APIs and systems.
Sometimes I need working code examples.
I'd rather describe behavior than implement it."
```

### Researcher
```
"I need to prototype ideas quickly.
I think in concepts, not syntax.
Code is a tool, not the goal."
```

### AI-Assisted Developer
```
"Why memorize APIs when I can describe intent?
I focus on architecture and design.
AI handles boilerplate and syntax."
```

## Why Traditional IDEs Don't Work

### VS Code
```
❌ Optimized for writing code
❌ File tree is primary navigation
❌ Assumes you know what file you want
❌ Terminal and git are prominent
❌ Overwhelming for note-takers
```

### Obsidian
```
✅ Great for notes and thinking
✅ Graph view for connections
✅ Wiki links for organization
❌ Can't execute code
❌ No real IDE features
❌ Basic preview only
```

## Our Solution

See: [[Project Vision - Knowledge-First IDE]]

```
Start with Obsidian-like experience
    ↓
Add ability to execute code blocks
    ↓
Progressively reveal IDE features
    ↓
Natural language → Executable system
```

## The Future

As AI gets better, more people will work this way:
- Describe intent in natural language
- AI generates implementation
- Knowledge graphs track decisions
- Code is artifact, not source of truth

**Our IDE prepares for this future.**
