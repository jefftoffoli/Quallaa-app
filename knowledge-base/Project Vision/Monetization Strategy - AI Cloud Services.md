# Monetization Strategy: AI Cloud Services

## Business Model Overview

**Core Principle**: Open-source IDE + Paid AI cloud services

Quallaa follows the proven "open core" monetization model used successfully by:

- **Obsidian**: Free app, paid Sync and Publish tiers
- **GitHub**: Free repos, paid Actions/Copilot tiers
- **Notion**: Free personal, paid AI features
- **LogSeq**: Free app, paid Sync

## The Value Split

### Free Tier (Open Source IDE)

- Complete ownership of data (local markdown files)
- All core knowledge management features
    - [[Wiki Links]] and [[Backlinks Panel]]
    - [[Knowledge Graph View]]
    - [[Quick Switcher]] and [[Tags System]]
    - [[Daily Notes]]
    - [[WYSIWYG Markdown Editor]]
- No vendor lock-in, portable markdown
- Full IDE capabilities (debugging, git, terminal)
- Local-only operation, complete privacy

### Paid Tier (Cloud AI Services)

- "Quallaa Intelligence" or similar branding
- AI features that require significant compute
- GPU-powered semantic analysis
- Cross-document synthesis
- Advanced knowledge discovery

**Key Insight**: The limitations that make certain technologies unsuitable for
IDE integration (GPU requirements, latency, complexity) become **advantages for
SaaS monetization** - they create natural moats and reasons for users to pay.

## Primary Revenue Opportunity: DeepSeek-OCR Compression Service

### The Technology

[[DeepSeek-OCR Integration Assessment]] initially concluded this was unsuitable
for IDE integration due to:

- GPU requirements (16GB+ VRAM)
- 5-second latency per page
- 97% accuracy (insufficient for code editing)
- Complex Python/PyTorch stack

**However**, these "flaws" are actually **perfect for a paid cloud service**:

✅ GPU requirements = Natural moat (users can't easily self-host) ✅ 5-second
latency = Fine for async AI queries (users expect "thinking...") ✅ 97% accuracy
= Excellent for gist-based retrieval and semantic analysis ✅ Complex stack =
Centralized complexity, lean IDE client

### What Makes This Valuable

**Visual Context Compression (7-20x compression)**

- Compress user's entire knowledge base into compact visual representations
- Feed 10-20× more documents into LLM context windows
- Enable AI features impossible with text-only approaches

**The Differentiator**: While competitors use vector databases for semantic
search (good but standard), visual compression enables:

- True content synthesis across documents (not just similarity matching)
- Gist-based retrieval that understands document essence
- "Memory" features where AI actually reads your whole KB
- Temporal analysis across document history

## Product Tiers

## Economic Model

### Cost Structure (per user/month)

**GPU Compute Costs**:

- A100-40G instance: ~$1.50/hour on cloud providers
- Process 200,000 pages/day per GPU (from DeepSeek paper)
- User with 10,000 notes ≈ 10,000 pages → 3 minutes GPU time
- Daily compression: ~$0.08/day = **$2.40/month per active user**

**Optimization Strategies**:

- Batch overnight compression (amortize GPU across all users)
- Incremental compression (only new/changed documents during day)
- Multi-tenancy (process multiple users' KBs in parallel)
- Caching (recompute weekly unless documents change)
- Tiered compression (archive tier at higher ratios)

**Optimized Cost**: ~$1.50-2.00/month per active user

**Other Costs**:

- Storage: $0.10-0.50/month (compressed representations + embeddings)
- LLM API calls: $1-3/month (for AI Assistant features)
- Infrastructure: $0.50/month (load balancing, monitoring, etc.)

**Total COGS**: ~$3-6/month per active user

### Revenue Projections

## Why This Works Better Than Alternatives

### vs. Generic AI Features (GPT wrappers)

❌ **Problem**: Every tool can add ChatGPT integration ✅ **Our Advantage**:
Visual compression is novel, defensible tech

### vs. Vector Database Semantic Search

❌ **Problem**: Standard approach, not differentiated ✅ **Our Advantage**:
Better synthesis, not just similarity ⚡ **Actually**: We use both - vector DB
for free, visual compression for paid

### vs. Traditional Hosting/Sync

❌ **Problem**: Race to bottom on pricing, no moat ✅ **Our Advantage**: GPU
compute requirements create natural barrier

### vs. Enterprise Features Only

❌ **Problem**: Limits addressable market ✅ **Our Advantage**: Individual →
Team → Enterprise upgrade path
