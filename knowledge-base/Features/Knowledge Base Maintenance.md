# Knowledge Base Maintenance

## Overview

Knowledge bases accumulate technical debt through duplicates, orphaned notes,
stale content, and structural issues. **Prevention through good capture habits
delivers more value than extensive cleanup**. This document outlines
evidence-based maintenance strategies for Quallaa's knowledge management system.

## Core Principles

### Prevention Over Cleanup

The most effective maintenance happens at creation time:

- **Atomic notes**: One clear concept per note with descriptive titles
- **Immediate linking**: Connect to 2-3 existing notes during creation
- **Daily processing**: Review daily notes within 24-48 hours
- **Session cleanup**: 5-minute end-of-session maintenance prevents debt
  accumulation

### Reversibility by Default

All cleanup operations should be reversible:

- **Soft-delete with retention**: 30-90 day recovery windows
- **Move to trash** rather than permanent deletion
- **Comprehensive audit trails**: What, when, why, and how to reverse
- **Transaction compensation**: Ability to restore relationships and metadata

### Transparency in Operations

Users must understand what cleanup does and why:

- **Clear intent**: Explain reasoning before execution
- **Visible scope**: Show exactly what will be affected
- **Progress indication**: Real-time feedback during operations
- **Audit access**: Complete history of maintenance actions

## Types of Technical Debt

### 1. Duplicate Notes

**Problem**: Multiple notes representing the same concept with conflicting
information

**Detection Methods**:

- Lexical similarity (Levenshtein distance, threshold 0.7-0.9)
- Semantic similarity (BERT embeddings, cosine similarity >0.85)
- Graph Neural Networks (achieves F1-scores of 0.90-0.97)

**Resolution**:

- Present candidates for manual merge decision
- Show diff of conflicting properties
- Preserve all content during merge
- Update all incoming links automatically

### 2. Orphaned Notes

**Problem**: Notes with no incoming or outgoing links, reducing discoverability

**Detection Methods**:

- Graph query: `degree < 1`
- Connected components analysis
- Breadth-first search from known roots

**Resolution**:

- Flag for review rather than auto-delete
- Suggest potential links based on content similarity
- May be legitimate for new notes (grace period)

### 3. Stale Information

**Problem**: Content not updated within defined timeframes

**Staleness Score Formula**:

```
(current_date - last_modified) × (1 / modification_frequency)
```

**Combined Freshness Metric**:

- Recency: 60% weight
- Engagement: 40% weight
- View trends: Declining access indicates declining relevance

**Thresholds** (domain-dependent):

- Technical documentation: 90 days
- Policy documents: 180 days
- Reference material: 365 days

### 4. Low-Quality Content

**Problem**: Incomplete properties, missing relationships, poor semantic
coherence

**Detection Methods**:

- Property completeness: <60% threshold
- Broken links to deprecated entities
- BERT-based quality classifiers (F1-score >0.90)
- Contradictory statements or conceptual drift

**Resolution**:

- Flag for manual improvement
- Suggest missing properties
- Identify broken references

### 5. Structural Issues

**Problem**: Over-connected hubs creating bottlenecks, under-connected clusters
limiting navigation

**Detection**:

- Hub detection: nodes with degree >>average
- Cluster analysis: weakly connected components
- Path length analysis: excessive hops between concepts

**Resolution**:

- Suggest intermediary concepts for over-connected hubs
- Identify missing bridges between clusters

## Maintenance Cadence

### Daily (5 minutes at session end)

- Delete obvious temporary notes
- Fix note names/titles
- Add primary links to new notes
- Process quick captures into proper notes

### Weekly (15-30 minutes)

- Process inbox folders
- Review unfinished notes
- Run orphan detection
- Empty trash (if ready)
- Check for unused attachments

### Monthly (1 hour)

- **Birthday reviews**: Examine notes created 30 days ago
- Check for duplicates to merge
- Archive completed projects
- Update structure notes
- Review and merge similar tags

### Quarterly (2-3 hours)

- Comprehensive audit of note structure
- Review and optimize folder organization
- Delete truly obsolete archived material
- Major restructuring (only if needed)
- Plugin updates and configuration review

### Annual (half day)

- Strategic review of entire system
- Major taxonomy changes
- Export and backup verification
- System optimization

**Goal**: Lightweight continuous maintenance rather than periodic heroic efforts

## The Three-Question Deletion Test

Minimal cognitive overhead for deletion decisions:

**1. Does this contain unique value I can't easily recreate?**

- If NO → Delete
- If YES → Continue to question 2

**2. Is this relevant to current projects or areas?**

- If YES → Keep and improve
- If NO → Continue to question 3

**3. Did creating this take significant effort or thought?**

- If YES → Archive (with date tag)
- If NO → Delete

**Insight**: Most deletion anxiety stems from loss aversion rather than actual
future utility

---

## PARA Organization Method

**Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive** organizes by actionability:

### Projects

- Have defined end dates
- Active work with clear outcomes
- **Automatic archival**: When complete, move all notes to Archive

### Areas

- Ongoing responsibilities
- No end date
- Maintained continuously

### Resources

- Reference material
- Topics of interest
- Not currently active

### Archive

- Completed projects (dated)
- Obsolete but preserved material
- Searchable but not cluttering workspace

**Benefits**:

- Natural lifecycle management
- Psychological closure on completed work
- "Archive-first, delete-later" reduces decision fatigue
- Archive remains searchable without daily clutter

## Health Metrics

### Composite Health Score

Tracks overall knowledge base quality:

```
Health Score =
  (30% × Completeness Index) +
  (25% × (1 - Duplication Rate)) +
  (25% × (1 - Orphan Rate)) +
  (20% × (1 - Staleness Index))
```

**Component Metrics**:

- **Completeness Index**: Nodes with complete properties / total nodes
  (target >85%)
- **Duplication Rate**: Duplicate nodes / total nodes (target <5%)
- **Orphan Rate**: Orphaned nodes / total nodes (target <10%)
- **Staleness Index**: Content older than threshold / total content (target
  <20%)

### Graph Structure Metrics

**Average Degree**: `2 × Edges / Vertices`

- Target: 4-8 for well-connected knowledge bases
- Too low: Poor discoverability
- Too high: Noise from over-linking

**Clustering Coefficient**: Local triangle density

- Target: 0.3-0.7
- Below 0.2: Sparse connectivity hampering navigation

**Average Path Length**: Hops between concepts

- Target: 3-6 hops
- Exhibits "small world" property for good discoverability

**Network Density**: Actual edges / possible edges

- Target: 0.01-0.10 for large graphs
- Above 0.5: Over-linking creating noise

### Usage Metrics

**Search Success Rate**: Searches returning results / total searches

- Target: >90%

**Link Health**: Valid links / total links

- Target: >95%

**Update Rate**: Percentage modified in last 90 days

- Target: 10-30% per quarter (varies by domain)

### Explainability Layers

**Simple Layer** (for all users):

> "Deleted cache files unused for 6 months (234 items, 1.2 GB)"

**Intermediate Layer** (with context):

> "These temporary files were created during app installations and haven't been
> accessed since February. Deleting them frees storage without affecting
> functionality."

**Technical Layer** (full details):

> "Applied staleness threshold of 180 days combined with file extension matching
> (.tmp, .cache) and access pattern analysis showing zero opens since creation."

**Progressive disclosure**: Prevent overwhelming novices while satisfying
experts

## Recovery Architecture

### Soft-Delete Strategy

**Implementation**:

- Mark as deleted (don't physically remove)
- Maintain version history
- Create automatic backup before destruction
- Countdown timer display
- One-click restore throughout retention period

**Retention Periods**:

- Routine cache: 30 days
- Duplicate removal: 60 days
- Content deletion: 90 days
- User-created content: Longer retention

### Multi-Tier Recovery

**Immediate** (minutes):

- One-click undo from local cache
- Transaction log replay
- In-memory state restoration

**Short-term** (hours to days):

- Trash restoration
- Database snapshots
- Transaction replay from logs

**Long-term** (weeks to months):

- Archive retrieval
- Backup restoration
- Forensic reconstruction from audit trails

### Transaction Compensation

Unlike simple undo, requires:

- Restore from trash
- Reinstate file permissions
- Update relationship metadata
- Rebuild index entries
- Notify affected systems
- Maintain compensation audit trail
